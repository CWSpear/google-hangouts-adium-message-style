This is a theme based off of the [Google Hangouts](http://www.google.com/hangouts/), using Chris Coyier's [blog post from CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/replicating-google-hangouts-chat/) as a starting point.

Steps were taken to remove flexbox as a dependency (Adium's WebKit engine doesn't support it) and some minor quality-of-life tweaks as they fit my fancy (I felt that consecutive messages needed a little more spacing).

For group chats, I replaced incoming messages icons with a unqiue (to the person talking), persistent Identicon. I couldn't find a theme I liked that really distinguished people in group chats. That's really the main reason I set out to create this theme.
